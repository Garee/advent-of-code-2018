# Advent of Code 2018

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

These are my solutions expressed in the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language and formatted using [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/).

# Getting Started
